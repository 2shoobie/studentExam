# studentExam
this project is on student exam performance. The tools used in this project was Microsoft Excel and Microsoft SQL Server Management. The dataset came from kaggle.

Ask:
Which students scored the highest?
Which students scored the lowest?
What is the average that was scored from the students?
How were the parents level of education played a factor in the students performance?
How was the test preperation course play a factor in the students performance?


My answers through SQL: 
The students with the highest score from my observation were the females in reading and writing
The students with the lowest score from my observation were the males (except in math)
The average score in each subject is 69 (reading), 66 (math), and 68 (writing) 
How the parents level of education played a factor in the students performance is that their assitance helps them gain a bigger advantage against the student with parents of a lower level of education
Hw the test preperation course play a factor is that those who completed it would gain the advantage of scoring higher in their subject but mixing it with their parents high level of education they're bound to get a high score. Regardless their child could still fail their subject even with the odds in their favor.
